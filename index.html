      <p>Iâ€™m trying to make a few things work better.<br>
        Lately, I've been doing that from the business and product sides of the table, helping technology companies achieve sustainable revenue streams and processes.<br><br>

        I'm currently Global Head of Sponsorship at <a href="http://qbeats.com" target="_blank">qbeats</a>, a versatile quantitative-technology company that applies the power of technology and computers to a variety of problems in a scientific way.<br>
        Information is the first domain where it has applied its skills, indexing the world's online content to discover its monetary value. Companies use this valuation to better understand, distribute, access and sponsor content. I'm responsible for the sponsorship product and sales, working with advertisers to enable everyone to unlock premium content for free.<br><br>

        Before, I ran BD and Strategy at <a href="http://plyfe.com" target="_blank">Plyfe</a>, the easiest way for ad agencies and publishers to turn content into interactive experiences and distribute across websites, social media channels and ad-servers, <i>without having to write a line of code</i>.<br><br>

        I was also once on a mission to create a better way to get and discover content created by the main figures around popular interests. That was <a href="http://rolefeed.com">Rolefeed</a>, a platform that put together media channels with the most relevant social posts around big stories.<br><br>

        My interest in media and technology comes from many years working as a Creative Strategist at Ogilvy, where I developed <a href="https://www.behance.net/abramona" target="_blank">multi-channel campaigns and digital experiences</a> for companies like Coca-Cola, Heineken and Unilever. Some of that received international awards.<br><br></p>

        <div class="apart">
          <p>I write daily lines on <a href="https://twitter.com/abramona" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p></li>
          <p>Whenever I have the chance, I write more extended thoughts on <a href="https://medium.com/@abramona" target="_blank">Medium</a>.</p></li>
          <p>Most of that is related to media, technology, and finance.</p></div><br>

        <p>The gif below is there to make your visit more enjoyable. I update it on a weekly basis. If you see the same gif twice, you're probably looking to contact me: You can do so at <a href="mailto:abramona@gmail.com"> abramona [at] gmail [dot] com</a>, I try to keep up with it as best as I can.</p>
